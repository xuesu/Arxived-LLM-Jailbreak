### Turning Logic Against Itself : Probing Model Defenses Through Contrastive Questions
#### 1. Summary of this text
The paper introduces POATE, a jailbreak technique that leverages contrastive reasoning to generate prompts that bypass safety mechanisms in large language models.

### Token Highlighter: Inspecting and Mitigating Jailbreak Prompts for Large Language Models
#### 1. Summary of this text
The paper "Token Highlighter" by Hu et al. proposes a method to inspect and mitigate Jailbreak Attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA-2 and Vicuna-V1.5. The method involves a novel metric called Affirmation Loss to identify critical tokens in user queries linked to such attacks. By applying a technique termed Soft Removal, the influence of these tokens is reduced rather than entirely removed, which helps maintain the model's performance on benign inputs. Experimental results indicate that Token Highlighter effectively reduces the success rate of jailbreak attempts while preserving LLM utility.

#### 2. Related Metadata
- **Tools/Algorithms created**: Token Highlighter.
- **Benchmarks introduced**: None specified.
- **Codebase/Data URL**: [Token Highlighter on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TrustSafeAI/Token-Highlighter).
- **Evaluated LLMs**: LLaMA-2, Vicuna-V1.5.
- **Attack/Defense Techniques**: Jailbreak Attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR, TAP, Manyshot, AIM), Affirmation Loss, Soft Removal.
- **Frameworks Critiqued**: Not referenced in this section.

#### 3. Main Contributions
- **Novel Ideas**: Introduction of Token Highlighter and the concept of Affirmation Loss to detect critical tokens involved in jailbreak prompts.
- **Key Problems Addressed**: Reduces vulnerability of aligned LLMs to jailbreak attacks while maintaining performance on benign user queries.
- **Comparison to Existing Work**: Token Highlighter improves upon existing defenses by addressing their limitations in interpretability, performance drop on benign queries, and operational efficiency.

#### 4. Methods & Approach
Token Highlighter works through:
1. **Affirmation Loss**: Measures the model’s willingness to affirmatively respond based on token embeddings.
   - Defined with a loss function: 
   \[
   \text{Affirmation Loss}(x_{1:n}, \theta) = -\log P_\theta(y|x_{1:n}),
   \]
   where \( y \) is a fixed affirmative response.
   - **Critical Token Identification**: Uses gradients to assess each token's influence in generating affirmative responses.
   
2. **Soft Removal**: Applies a scaling factor \( \beta \) to the embeddings of identified tokens:
   \[
   x'_{i} = 
   \begin{cases} 
   \beta \times \text{embed}(q_i) & \text{if } q_i \in Q \\
   \text{embed}(q_i) & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}
   \]
   This method trades off the reduction of adversarial influences with the retention of semantic context.

#### 5. Findings & Empirical Results
- **Defense Effectiveness**: Demonstrated a significant reduction in the Attack Success Rate (ASR) from 0.730 to 0.142 using Token Highlighter on Vicuna-7B-V1.5.
- **Performance on Benign Queries**: Maintained a high Win Rate on the AlpacaEval benchmark.
- **Efficiency**: Token Highlighter only requires one query to compute the Affirmation Loss, making it more computationally efficient compared to other methods that require multiple queries.

#### 6. Implications for LLM Safety
The findings suggest that Token Highlighter can strengthen model robustness against adversarial inputs by effectively identifying and mitigating harmful prompt components. This addresses safety concerns related to misuse of LLMs and enhances interpretability by explaining refusal based on identified critical tokens.

#### 7. Missing Information & Caveats
- **Missing Sections**: The text appears to be complete in terms of the abstract provided but lacks specific empirical results or numerical benchmarks beyond summary statistics.
- **Ambiguities**: Details on the proposed baselines for defense methods may have been simplistic and not fully exhaustive in terms of their arrangement and implementation specifics. Further details on the robustness of Token Highlighter against novel adaptive attacks would be beneficial.

The method masks harmful keywords in queries, generates benign versions using special tokens, and links them with assistive tasks to elicit harmful responses effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SATA outperforms previous baselines, achieving high attack success rates and harmful scores on benchmark datasets.
